Heres my ideas for the colors app, and its experimental use of Cloud kit and Core Data

## Phase 1

- Get colors to appear on screen

## Phase 2

- Add collections of colors
- Calculate between RGB and hex

## Phase 3

- Use of iCloud data

## Day log

### Day 1
Completed color view, and color view model will change from RGB to hex

### Day 2
Created list view for viewing swatches, colors etc

Need to fix hex converter (doesn't add 0's)

### Day 3 - 4
Cloudkit can mirror core data so lets get that working first.
Got palettes main data manager created.
Renamed swatches -> palettes and colors -> swatches
