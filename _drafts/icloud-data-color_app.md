Heres my ideas for the colors app, and its expirimental use of iCloud data

## Phase 1

- Get colors to appear on screen

## Phase 2

- Add collections of colors
- Calculate between RGB and hex

## Phase 3

- Use of iCloud data

## Day log

### Day 1
Completed color view, and color view model will change from rgb to hex
