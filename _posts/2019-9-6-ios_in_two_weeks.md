So my college starts late in the year. Its September 4th and I still have a week and a half till classes begin. With that, I've always wanted to check out iOS development. So I figure with only 12 days to go let's see how far I can go and if I should think more about iOS and less about web dev. This isn't a #100DaysOfCode challenge but it is twelve... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Background
To set the stage, I've been programming since high school, but only got intense when I started college studying computer science. I have programmed an [Android App](https://github.com/peterfoxflick/Messji) with two friends for a class and this isn't my first time pocking around in XCode, although my only app to date is a button that changes the text of a title (hello world level).

## Goal
Today I want to get started with [Apple's getting started guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/), from there I'm going to go more freeform and try making my app from scratch.

## Update
That begin said, I ended up changing from learning Swift from the Getting Started Guide to the [Learning SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/).
